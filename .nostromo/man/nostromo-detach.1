.SH NAME
.PP
nostromo-detach - Detach a command node into a new manifest


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBnostromo detach [name] [key.path]... [options] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Detach will extract an entire command tree from the given node and
create a brand new manifest under the ships/ folder.

.PP
Running:

.PP
.RS

.nf
nostromo detach mobile-builds build.ios build.android

.fi
.RE

.PP
creates a new mobile-builds.yaml file with build command sets joined in the
new manifest. If a file with the target name already exists, nostromo will
attempt to merge the manifests automatically.

.PP
By default, the detached node is removed from the manifest. If this node should
be kept in the original manifest, use the --keep flag.

.PP
This is a convenient way to slice your command sets and produce manifests
that can be shared via the sync command.
