.SH NAME
.PP
nostromo-add-cmd - Add a command to nostromo manifest


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBnostromo add cmd [key.path] [command] [options] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Add a command to nostromo manifest for a given key path.
A key path is a '.' delimited string, e.g., "key.path" which represents
the alias which can be run as "key path" for the actual command provided.

.PP
This will create appropriate command scopes for all levels in the provided
key path. A command scope can contain a tree of sub commands and
substitutions.

.PP
A command's mode indicates how it will be executed. By default, nostromo
concatenates parent and child commands along the tree. There are 3 modes
available to commands:

.PP
concatenate  Concatenate this command with subcommands exactly as defined
  independent  Execute this command with subcommands using ';' to separate
  exclusive    Execute this and only this command ignoring parent commands

.PP
You can set using -m or --mode when adding a command or globally using:
  nostromo manifest set mode
